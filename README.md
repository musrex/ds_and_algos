# Merrimack MSCS CSC6013 Algorithms & Discrete Structures

Course Description: This foundational course is an introduction to algorithmic thinking and the
mathematics of computer science. Topics include abstract data types such as lists, stacks, queues,
hash maps, trees and graphs, but also basics of asymptotic analysis, recursion, and various
algorithmic strategies including brute force, decrease-and-conquer, and divide-and-conquer.
Programming exercises will help create proficiency in Python Programming language. Emphasis
will be placed on understanding underlying mathematics, such as discrete probability, statistics,
graph theory, and set theory.
